This is a music player built for android 10 (api 29) built With kotlin and jetpack compose and is still incomplete. I need to build the permission request dialogs. And the add to playlist is still incomplete,

To run the app, install it regardless of the play protect warning. Then open the apps in settings and give it the permission it requires (Settings -> Apps -> Kensi -> Permissions)

If you  like the app, keep waiting, I'll finish it soon. Raise issue for every bug you've faced. Build it further by forking it or raising pull requests.

 Thanks. ~dos
